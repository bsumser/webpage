Quote from Frank Herbet musing on the knowns and unkowns of the <a href="https://youtu.be/SzjxktnHAHc?t=180">universe.</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But its like a balloon. The surface of the balloon is the face of what we do not know. Inside the baloon as we blow into it
is what we have proved. But as we increase what we think we know, we increase our exposure to what we do not know. This is one
of the inevitable laws of our universe. But isnt it more interesting, to live in a universe where there are unkowns to discover,
new lands to explore, than to live in an absolute box where when you find the edge, no place to go from there. I like the fact that
we cannot predict everything, I like the fact we live in a universe where anything may happen. Because the alternative to me is a
constricting dead end.
