## Credits

Thanks to [morhetz](https://github.com/morhetz) for creating the gruvbox color scheme. I use it in almost all the programs on my pc.

Credit to Niklas Luhmann for pioneering the Zettelkasten method for personal knowledge managment. This kind of system always intrigued me
ever since I about the interconnected web of hypercards from Neal Stephenson's book Snow Crash.

[Hugo Cisneros'](https://hugocisneros.com/blog/my-org-roam-notes-workflow/) scripts and method of generating a graph of zettelkasten notes
has been pretty shamelessly copied for use. Without his python program for generating a graph json, I don't think I would have been able to get
this working.

[System Crafters](https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/) org-publish guide was very helpful as well.
