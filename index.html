    	<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
			<p>Machine Learning Neural Network programmed in C++.
			The inspiration for this project was my experience working with wine in
			a restaurant. I thought that making a neural network that was able to differentiate
			between different varietals of wine would be educational for my future projects.</p>

			<p>Using a raspberry pi connected to my home network, I set up a python script that
			would scan that network to see if my phone was connected, such as when I was getting
			home from work. Once the raspberry pi detected my phone on the network, it would
			boot my desktop via a wake on lan signal. This allowed me to have my computer booted
			when I walked into my room.</p>
