    	<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
			<p>Machine Learning Neural Network programmed in C++.
			The inspiration for this project was my experience working with wine in
			a restaurant. I thought that making a neural network that was able to differentiate
			between different varietals of wine would be educational for my future projects.</p>

			<p>C++ implementation of the Fourier Transform. This was a 2 person group project for a
			course focused on parallel computing. Different versions of fast fourier transform algorithms
			were studied, and we attempted to implement various parallel computing technology such as
			MPI, or OpenMP.
			</p>

			<p>Using a raspberry pi connected to my home network, I set up a python script that
			would scan that network to see if my phone's IP address connected to the network. 
			Once the raspberry pi detected my phone on the network, it would
			boot my desktop via a wake on lan signal. This allowed me to have my computer booted
			when I walked into my room.</p>
