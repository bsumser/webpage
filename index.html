    	<h1> About Me </h1>
    		<p> Growing up, I have always enjoyed the 
			practical applications to computer science. </p>

    	<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
			<p>Machine Learning Neural Network programmed in C++.
			The inspiration for this project was my experience working with wine in
			a restaurant. I thought that making a neural network that was able to differentiate
			between different varietals of wine would be educational for my future projects.</p>
    	<h2>Programming Langauges</h2>
        	<p>Here are some of the languages I am familiar with:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>C/C++</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Bash</li>
				<li>Latex</li>
