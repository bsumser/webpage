    	<h1> About Me </h1>
    		<p> Growing up, I have always enjoyed the practical applications to computer science. 
			It has always seemed almost like a form of magic to me, giving life to machinery via
			code.</p>

    	<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
			<p>Machine Learning Neural Network programmed in C++.
			The inspiration for this project was my experience working with wine in
			a restaurant. I thought that making a neural network that was able to differentiate
			between different varietals of wine would be educational for my future projects.</p>

			<p>Using a raspberry pi connected to my home network, I set up a python script that
			would scan that network to see if my phone was connected, such as when I was getting
			home from work. Once the raspberry pi detected my phone on the network, it would
			boot my desktop via a wake on lan signal. This allowed me to have my computer booted
			when I walked into my room.</p>
    	<h2>Programming Langauges</h2>
        	<p>Here are some of the languages I am familiar with:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>C/C++</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Bash</li>
				<li>Latex</li>
			</ul>
