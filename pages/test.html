			<a href="https://github.com/bsumser/neuralNetwork">Machine Learning Neural Network</a> programmed in C++.
			The inspiration for this project was my experience working with wine in
			a restaurant. I thought that making a neural network that was able to differentiate
			between different varietals of wine would be educational for my future projects.

			<a href="https://github.com/bsumser/neuralNetwork">C++ implementation of the Fourier Transform.</a>
			This was a 2 person group project for a
			course focused on parallel computing. Different versions of fast fourier transform algorithms
			were studied, and we attempted to implement various parallel computing technology such as
			MPI, or OpenMP.
